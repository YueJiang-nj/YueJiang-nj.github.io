  <h2><a name="q1">How do I communicate accessibility needs to CHI2023 organizers?</a></h2>

  <p>The Accessibility Chairs for CHI2023 are Benjamin Tannert, Yue Jiang, Claudia Loitsch, Megan Hofmann, whose goal is to ensure the conference is accessible to everyone. When you register for the conference, there will be a registration question labelled "Do you have a disability or special need which requires our awareness?". In your response, please indicate any accessibility needs such as wheelchair access, sign language interpretation, or a guide. The Accessibility Chairs will follow up with you to clarify your needs. You can contact them directly at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:accessibility@chi2023.acm.org">accessibility@chi2023.acm.org</a>.</p>

  <h2><a name="q2">Who do I ask if my question is not answered here?</a></h2>

  <p>More information about accessibility at Congress Center Hamburg (CCH) is available on their <a href="https://www.cch.de/en/visit/barrier-free-access">accessibility information page</a>.</p>

  <p>If there is specific accessibility information you would like to see here, or if you wish to discuss any conference accessibility requirements, please contact our Accessibility Chairs, Benjamin Tannert, Yue Jiang, Claudia Loitsch, Megan Hofmann by email: <a href="mailto:accessibility@chi2023.acm.org">accessibility@chi2023.acm.org</a>, and someone will respond to you shortly.</p>

  <h2><a name="q3">Will sign language interpretation or captioning be available?</a></h2>

  <p>The conference will provide a team of sign language interpreters or captioners if requested by any attendees during the early registration period. Please make your request as early as possible. Our Accessibility Chairs will follow up with you to discuss your needs in more detail. After March 23rd, 2023, the best effort will be made to accommodate requests, but we cannot guarantee that interpreters or captioners will be available.</p>

  <h2><a name="q4">What are the public transport options for getting to the conference venue?</a></h2>

Arriving by plane: Hamburg has an international airport HAM Hamburg Airport (https://www.airport-hamburg.com)
From the airport it takes about 30-45 minutes to the conference venue CCH via public transport (e.g., with a single ride S-Bahn trip for ca. 3.50 Euros) or taxis (approximately 30-40 Euros). 
Further information can be found here: <a href="https://www.cch.de/en/visit/arrival/plane">Plane Info</a>.
<br><br>
Arriving by public transit: Hamburg has some major train stations such as Hamburg Central Station, Altona Station, Harburg Station and Dammtor Station. The closest train station is <a href="https://www.bahnhof.de/bahnhof-en/Hamburg-Dammtor-3807358">Dammtor Station</a>, which is literally directly next to the conference venue CCH.
Further information can be found here: <a href="https://www.cch.de/en/visit/arrival/rail-travel">Train Info</a>.
If you plan to arrive by train, we offer the Deutsche Bahn's Event Ticket, which allows for long-distance trains powered by 100% renewable energy and, therefore, brings about a sustainable reduction in CO2 emissions from travel to an event.
Further information can be found here: <a href="https://www.cch.de/fileadmin/cch/pdf/db_event_ticket_faqs-1.pdf">Event Ticket</a>
<br><br>
Arriving by car: While it is possible to arrive by car, we strongly advise against it, since there will be a lot of traffic, as well as only a few expensive parking options. Further information can be found here: <a href="https://www.cch.de/en/visit/arrival/travel-by-car">Car Info</a>.


  <h2><a name="q5">Who can I ask about accessibility in Hamburg, Germany?</a></h2>

  <h2><a name="q6">Can a student volunteer assist me during the conference?</a></h2>

  <p>Student volunteers will be available to assist attendees with disabilities with navigation, meal service, or other accessibility needs. If you will need volunteer assistance at the conference, please indicate this on your conference registration form.</p>


  <p>Attendees who require personal care assistance should bring their own assistant. Personal care assistants do not need to register for the conference. If the assistant will be having food and drink provided by the conference during coffee/tea breaks, lunches, and/or the reception, we ask that these be added into the attendee's registration at the 'extra options' stage of the registration process.</p>

  <h2><a name="q7">What is the conference space like?</a></h2>

  <p>For the overall layout of the venue, please refer to this <a href="https://www.cch.de/planen/downloads">map of the conference space</a>.</p>

  <p>The CCH – Congress Center Hamburg is a convention center without barriers. Its barrier-free architectural design concept was developed jointly with representatives of organizations dedicated to promoting inclusion. The CCH now not only features stair-free access, reduced counter and handrail heights and a floor-integrated guiding system leading from the forecourt all the way to the halls but also high-contrast visual information, high-visibility markings on steps and tactile floor identification panels. Information panels in Braille and tactile profile lettering have been installed in key locations, including elevators, to assist visually impaired and blind persons. This means that anyone with a disability can participate in events at the CCH, no matter what their specific physical challenge may be.
    <br>
    <br>
Other features that support accessibility:  <br>
- Conference rooms: inductive hearing systems for good speech intelligibility   <br>
- Main entrances to the CCH: automatic sliding doors    <br>
- Multi-storey car park: 24-hour access (access and intermediate doors in parking areas U2 and U1 or to the elevators are triggered by radar sensors) and marked parking spaces for the disabled    <br>
- Access from the car park to the public area: barrier-free accessible via automatic doors  <br>
- Generous spatial arrangements and installations of toilet areas   <br>
- Emergency call for the deaf (A1.1, A1.2, A1.3/ A07/ A12.1, A12.2 and in the glass foyer elevator/ A13/ A14)   <br>
- Ramps: have handrails throughout  <br>
- Stairs: step markings and handrails on both sides <br></p>

  <p>In case of an emergency and call for evacuation, Public safety officers will assist and orient people with disabilities (e.g., blind and visually impaired attendees, people with hearing impairments) to safety.</p>
